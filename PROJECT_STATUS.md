## üö® CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE

### Component Detail Picture Display Problem
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: UNRESOLVED
- **Issue**: Pictures don't appear on component detail page immediately after create/edit redirect

**What Works**: ‚úÖ
- Frontend validation (submit button disabled until valid)
- File saving to `/components/` directory  
- Database record creation with URLs
- Pictures appear after manual page refresh

**What Doesn't Work**: ‚ùå
- Pictures don't show immediately after redirect from form submission
- User must manually refresh page to see pictures

**Investigation Completed**: 
- Database query fixed (`joinedload(ComponentVariant.variant_pictures)`)
- Session management attempted multiple approaches
- Debug logging added for picture URL tracking
- File storage verification confirmed working

## Current Work in Progress

### Frontend Validation System
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Description**: Real-time validation preventing invalid form submissions

#### Completed:
- ‚úÖ Submit button disabled when no variants added
- ‚úÖ Dynamic validation status panel with color-coded feedback
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates on variant/picture changes
- ‚úÖ Prevention of backend errors and hanging buttons
- ‚úÖ Clear user guidance with specific error messages

## Recent Commits
1. `bfc6836` - Refactor component forms: Unify create and edit endpoints with shared logic
2. `578f3f5` - Remove unused repositories folder and empty __init__.py files
3. `4275ffa` - Clean up unused files and reduce codebase bloat
4. `f445ffd` - Refactor index.html into modular components for improved maintainability
5. `eb030ad` - Complete modular refactoring: Extract routes.py to API and web blueprints

## Architecture Changes
- Moving from flat route structure to organized blueprints:
  - `/app/api/` - REST API endpoints
  - `/app/web/` - Web interface routes
  - `/app/services/` - Business logic
  - `/app/utils/` - Utility functions

## Next Steps
1. Complete route migration and test all endpoints
2. Update documentation to reflect new structure
3. Consider creating integration tests for the new blueprint structure
4. Review and optimize import statements

## Notes
- WebDAV integration has been added (see WEBDAV_SETUP.md)
- Docker configuration has been updated
- Following RULES.md for development practices
- Added database connection rules to RULES.md for better project understanding

## Recent Work Completed

### Component Variants Workflow Analysis
- Analyzed complete workflow for managing component variants and pictures
- Documented in PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md with detailed sections covering:
  - Frontend structure and UI elements
  - Variant creation and color selection process
  - Picture management (upload, display, actions)
  - Form submission and server-side processing
  - Database operations and triggers
  - API endpoints and error handling
  - Special features like drag & drop and real-time updates

### Documentation Updates
- Added Rule #12 to RULES.md about maintaining single PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md file
- Created comprehensive PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md as central workflow documentation
- Organized with table of contents for easy navigation

### Key Findings
- Variants use temporary IDs (`new_1`, `new_2`) until saved
- SKUs auto-generated by PostgreSQL triggers using pattern: `supplier_code_product_number_color_name`
- Picture names also auto-generated by database triggers
- Complex validation ensures no duplicate colors per component
- Drag & drop support with visual feedback
- Change tracking with confirmation modal before saving
