# Tools Directory

**Purpose**: Professional development, deployment, and maintenance utilities for the Component Management System

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
tools/
├── dev/                # Development utilities
├── deploy/             # Deployment scripts  
├── maintenance/        # System maintenance tools
├── scripts/            # Test runners and build scripts
└── README.md          # This file
```

## 🛠️ Tool Categories

### **Development Tools (`tools/dev/`)**
- Database seeding and migration utilities
- Code generation tools (API docs, schema docs)
- Development environment setup
- Local development helpers

### **Deployment Tools (`tools/deploy/`)**
- Production deployment scripts
- Environment configuration management
- Backup and restore utilities
- Health check tools

### **Maintenance Tools (`tools/maintenance/`)**
- Database cleanup utilities
- File system maintenance
- Performance monitoring
- System health checks

### **Scripts (`tools/scripts/`)**
- Test runners and automation
- Build and compilation scripts
- Continuous integration helpers

## 🚫 What Does NOT Belong Here

- ❌ Random debug scripts (use `debug_scripts/` folder instead)
- ❌ One-off testing scripts
- ❌ Quick fixes and patches
- ❌ Personal experiment files
- ❌ Temporary API test scripts

## 📋 Usage Guidelines

### **Before Adding New Tools:**
1. **Purpose**: Tool must serve ongoing development/deployment needs
2. **Documentation**: Include clear usage instructions and examples
3. **Quality**: Code should be production-quality, not throwaway scripts
4. **Organization**: Place in appropriate subdirectory

### **Tool Standards:**
- Include proper argument parsing with `--help`
- Add error handling and user-friendly messages
- Follow project coding standards (no comments, self-documenting code)
- Include usage examples in docstrings

## 🔧 Core Development Commands

```bash
# Test execution
python tools/scripts/run_tests.py --fast
python tools/scripts/run_tests.py --coverage

# Development setup
python tools/dev/setup_dev_environment.py
python tools/dev/seed_database.py

# Deployment
python tools/deploy/deploy_production.py
python tools/deploy/backup_database.py

# Maintenance
python tools/maintenance/cleanup_old_files.py
python tools/maintenance/health_check.py
```

This organization ensures tools/ serves its proper purpose as a professional development utilities directory.
